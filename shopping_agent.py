"""Shopping agent starter — OpenAI Agents SDK, with the
ProveCart conformity check wired BEFORE payment.

The pattern this starter teaches (copy it, keep it):

    customer instruction -> build cart -> CHECK -> MATCH: pay
                                              -> BLOCK: fix inside
                                                 the customer's
                                                 authorization and
                                                 re-check (linked)
                                              -> REVIEW: stop and
                                                 ask the customer

The payment tool refuses to run unless the most recent check in
this process returned MATCH. That refusal is the point of the
starter: the check is a structural step in the flow, not a
suggestion in a prompt.

Offline by default: with LIVE_MODE unset/false, the check tool
routes to a local mock with the same response shape, so the whole
loop runs with no keys at all. Set LIVE_MODE=true and
PROVECART_API_KEY to call the real ProveCart API (free signup for
an integrator key: https://provecart.com/agents.md).

Run the offline demo:   python shopping_agent.py
Run with the SDK loop:  python shopping_agent.py --sdk   (needs
                        OPENAI_API_KEY; LIVE_MODE decides check
                        target)
